# Inclusive Avatar Design Guidelines

## 1.  Avatar Body Appearance
### 1.1. Support disability representation in social VR avatars.

Social VR avatars should let users freely present their disabilities. Like any other user groups, people with disabilities want to present their disability identity in social VR. However, they often can’t find readily available options to do so. Developers and designers should include more avatar features that represent multiple disabilities, such as offering different types of assistive devices like prosthetics for users to easily add on to their avatars, or allowing self-uploaded contents for creative and individualized disability representation.

*“I think the biggest thing for me is the flexibility and the freedom to choose [how I can represent myself.] I would like to represent myself [in social VR] as an accurate reflection of what I look like. For what I've seen online, there is no standard option in the avatar creation [to represent my prosthesis]. I think that would be great to see if such a thing existed.”*
– an amputee

*“[I want to] artistically represent my disability, [for example,] I had a circle over one eye [to symbolize that] ‘I'm looking through a tunnel,’ and then having a tape over this eye.”*

### 1.2. Default to a full-body avatar to enable the representation of a broad range of disabilities across different body parts.

Different disabilities may affect or be reflected in different body parts. It is thus important to offer full-body avatars to enable a wide range of disability representation options. For example, for users with lower limb disabilities, avatar templates which include further customization of the lower body would be important to present their disabilities (e.g., wearing a prosthetic leg).  Moreover, a full-body avatar provides more space to demonstrate the lived experiences of people with disabilities, e.g., how a person with visual impairments navigates the environment.

*“People can only get my whole disability identity with the full body.”*
– a person with cerebral palsy

*“I prefer a full-body avatar, because [it shows] how [people with disabilities] navigate the pathway, how they move the hands and the fingers, and how they read braille. Everything can be oriented to the people.”*

### 1.3. Enable customization of each body part instead of non-adjustable predefined sets.

Providing only avatars with “standard” body compositions prevents people with bodily differences from representing themselves accurately. Avatar platforms should allow the customization of each body part of an avatar. For example, avatar platforms should offer options to customize the presence, length, and strength of each limb; and users can select their preferred colors for various avatar components (e.g., eye color, hair color, or skin color). Asymmetrical design options of body parts (e.g., eyes, ears) should also be available. For example, allowing users to select the size and detailed look of each eyeball to reflect disabilities such as strabismus. 

*“It would be important to be able to customize each individual portion of the body. Right now, if you select the bigger one [for your] shoulders, it makes everything bigger. But that's not the case. [It would be better] if you could do, [for example,] the left arm, the right arm, even elbows, your stomach, chest, and neck, like all the different things.”*
– a person with mobility disabilities and mental health conditions

*“I have a limb difference, [and I am] a left forearm amputation. So I would really like to see characters where maybe they don't have two long arms, but they have one long standard arm and one shorter [arm], like to the elbow. Or even if they do have two long arms, but one of them doesn't have a hand, or just one round-off around the wrist [...] instead of extending completely with a five-fingered hand.”*
– an amputee

*“I have one eye that's in a completely different shape than the other. So I think being able to customize your eyes to two different shapes should reflect what is actually going on on your face. Now you can only pick one set.”*

### 1.4. Prioritize human avatars to emphasize the “humanity” rather than the “disability” aspect in disability representation. 

People with disabilities often face misconceptions that they are either ‘superheroes’ or ‘tragic’, which reduce individuals to their disability label rather than seeing them as whole persons. To avoid such misconceptions, avatars should have human-like models to represent disability as an integral part of personal identities, which often intersect with other identities such as race and gender. People with disabilities also reported feeling more connected to humanoid avatars when representing personal identities in social VR.

*“Humanoid avatars show me as a whole person. I identify as a black woman with a disability, and that's really important when discussing a personal identity, because when describing somebody, you wouldn't just say, ‘Oh, they have a disability,’ instead you would say, ‘Oh, they're non-binary or female, and they're African American or Caucasian, and they have a disability.’ They all go together.”*

### 1.5. Provide non-human avatar options to free users from social stigma in real life. 

People with disabilities often face judgment based on their physical differences in real life. Avatars with non-human forms, such as robots and animals, can potentially lower others’ expectations of “typical” appearance and behaviors, freeing people with disabilities from societal judgements and stigma often associated with disabilities. 

*"I think [non-human avatars] hide more of my real disabilities, like being the opposite of showing off my disabilities."* 
– a person with cerebral palsy

*"It feels like people's expectations of how neurotypical I'm gonna seem are lowered if I'm a robot or just a non-human avatar."*
– a person with mental health conditions

## 2. Avatar Body Dynamics: Facial Expression, Posture, and Body Motion
### 2.1. Allow the simulation of behavioral characteristics related to disability only based on users’ preference.

Representing the realistic movements of people with disabilities on avatars could make them feel more connected with their avatars and immersed in the VR experience. For instance, a person with Tourette’s Syndrome may have tics on their face and prefer showing them authentically via their avatar design. However, the realistic simulation of disability-related behaviors on avatars may also reinforce the stereotype people with disabilities experience in real life. For example, for people who experience unconventional or involuntary movements (e.g., stumbling, nervous tics), directly simulating these movements can be disrespectful and should be avoided. Developers should be careful not to create simulations that may cause misunderstanding or reinforce stereotypes, and should only do so if users prefer it. 

*“I think it would be cool if you could choose to have [the movement to be reflected]. But I also think that it is a very fine line between inclusion and offensive imitation.”* 
– a person with mobility disabilities

*“The way I move authentically is kind of jaggy, and I swerve. People asked me if I'm drunk all the time. So you know I'd like to go as quickly as I can in a smooth way [...] even though that's not authentic.* 
– a person with mobility disabilities

*“I have nervous tics that are kind of full body shutters. When I do those in real life, the VR avatar does often follow those, which makes it hard for people to figure out if it's glitching out or something. So finding ways to make those smoother and more reflective of reality, rather than like, 'is this internet thing? or what's happening?'”*

### 2.2. Enable expressive facial animations that deliver a spectrum of emotions.

For people with invisible disabilities, enabling expressive facial expressions is critical because their conditions (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety) often surface through their emotions. It’s especially important to include expressions representing both positive and negative emotions (e.g., sadness, anxiety, or even crying) to portray the user’s mental status visually and demonstrate what they are really feeling.  

*“Depression is part of my life, and I think avatars need to spend a little more time not looking so happy all the time, which is not an option there. [The avatars] are always smiling. I think that needs to be a little bit more [variations].”*
– A person with severe depression

*“When representing depression, the facial expression is more sad or in thought. And then when having ADHD moments, [the avatar] being more excited or manic.”*
– A person with depression and ADHD

<ins>Example:</ins>
Avatar shows diverse emotions, including anxiety (left), sadness (middle), and happiness (right).

### 2.3. Prioritize equitable capability and performance of avatar over the authentic behaviors of people with disabilities.

While people with disabilities should have the option to reflect their unique movements through their avatars if they so choose (e.g., limp while walking), these movement characteristics should not impact the capabilities or performance of the avatar, thus creating a fair user experience for all. For example, the movement speed of an avatar in a wheelchair should be the same as the walking speed of other avatars. 

*“I walk with a slight limp, [but] I don't think I need the actual movement [on avatars] to reflect how [fast] I walk. [Because] when I use games, I see the movement aspect more of a practicality than part of the game [...] I think having a limp would be cool, but I wouldn't want to be slower than [other avatars]. I wouldn't want to have a maximum speed, because I chose to have a limp earlier in the avatar making process."* 
– a person with mobility disabilities 

*“Being able to just keep up with peers’ [avatars], pace-wise, would be the most important thing.”* 
– a person with mobility disabilities

<ins>Example:</ins>
The avatar with the wheelchair moves at the same speed as the avatar without the wheelchair.

### 2.4. Leverage avatar posture and motion to demonstrate the lived experiences of people with disabilities. 

Beyond presenting the disability in itself, users also want to reflect their lived experience with disabilities via avatars through avatar posture or motion for awareness purposes. For example, a low vision person may adopt a unique head position, turning their head slightly to one side to see with their better eye, or a blind person may bend their body forwards in an attempt to better capture sound; representing these behaviors on avatars helps other users acknowledge that these mannerisms are not a sign of disinterest in social interactions but rather a means to better engage in conversations.

*“[My] vision is directed at one angle. So my head is turned lightly, because I'm not looking at people directly all the time.”* 
– a low vision person

*“The visually impaired people are not standing strictly. Slightly bending down towards the front is a common feature of the visually impaired people if they have visual disability by birth. Because instead of looking at the person who is speaking, they take their ears nearby to the place where the sound is coming from, instead of [looking at the speaker's] face. This gives some wrong impressions to the people that the visually impaired people have not given attention to the speakers. That is not the real story.”*
– a blind person

*“Typically you're in a VR situation, and you're facing somebody and focused on looking at one another. [But] a lot of times when I look at somebody, my eyes are not looking at their face all the time. So I think having the ability to look at other places while I'm facing somebody would be important to me. Because that helps me represent the way that I interact with people.”* 
– a person with ADHD
