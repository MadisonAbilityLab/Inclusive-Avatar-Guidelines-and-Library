# Inclusive Avatar Design Guidelines

## 1.  Avatar Body Appearance
### 1.1 Support disability representation in social VR avatars.

Social VR avatars should let users freely present their disabilities. Like any other user groups, people with disabilities want to present their disability identity in social VR. However, they often can’t find readily available options to do so. Developers and designers should include more avatar features that represent multiple disabilities, such as offering different types of assistive devices like prosthetics for users to easily add on to their avatars, or allowing self-uploaded contents for creative and individualized disability representation.

*“I think the biggest thing for me is the flexibility and the freedom to choose [how I can represent myself.] I would like to represent myself [in social VR] as an accurate reflection of what I look like. For what I've seen online, there is no standard option in the avatar creation [to represent my prosthesis]. I think that would be great to see if such a thing existed.”*
– an amputee

*“[I want to] artistically represent my disability, [for example,] I had a circle over one eye [to symbolize that] ‘I'm looking through a tunnel,’ and then having a tape over this eye.”*
– a person with low vision
