# Inclusive Avatar Design Guidelines

## 1.  Avatar Body Appearance
### 1.1. Support disability representation in social VR avatars.

Social VR avatars should let users freely present their disabilities. Like any other user groups, people with disabilities want to present their disability identity in social VR. However, they often can’t find readily available options to do so. Developers and designers should include more avatar features that represent multiple disabilities, such as offering different types of assistive devices like prosthetics for users to easily add on to their avatars, or allowing self-uploaded contents for creative and individualized disability representation.

*“I think the biggest thing for me is the flexibility and the freedom to choose [how I can represent myself.] I would like to represent myself [in social VR] as an accurate reflection of what I look like. For what I've seen online, there is no standard option in the avatar creation [to represent my prosthesis]. I think that would be great to see if such a thing existed.”*

*“[I want to] artistically represent my disability, [for example,] I had a circle over one eye [to symbolize that] ‘I'm looking through a tunnel,’ and then having a tape over this eye.”*

### 1.2. Default to a full-body avatar to enable the representation of a broad range of disabilities across different body parts.

Different disabilities may affect or be reflected in different body parts. It is thus important to offer full-body avatars to enable a wide range of disability representation options. For example, for users with lower limb disabilities, avatar templates which include further customization of the lower body would be important to present their disabilities (e.g., wearing a prosthetic leg).  Moreover, a full-body avatar provides more space to demonstrate the lived experiences of people with disabilities, e.g., how a person with visual impairments navigates the environment.

*“People can only get my whole disability identity with the full body.”*

*“I prefer a full-body avatar, because [it shows] how [people with disabilities] navigate the pathway, how they move the hands and the fingers, and how they read braille. Everything can be oriented to the people.”*

### 1.3. Enable customization of each body part instead of non-adjustable predefined sets.

Providing only avatars with “standard” body compositions prevents people with bodily differences from representing themselves accurately. Avatar platforms should allow the customization of each body part of an avatar. For example, avatar platforms should offer options to customize the presence, length, and strength of each limb; and users can select their preferred colors for various avatar components (e.g., eye color, hair color, or skin color). Asymmetrical design options of body parts (e.g., eyes, ears) should also be available. For example, allowing users to select the size and detailed look of each eyeball to reflect disabilities such as strabismus. 

*“It would be important to be able to customize each individual portion of the body. Right now, if you select the bigger one [for your] shoulders, it makes everything bigger. But that's not the case. [It would be better] if you could do, [for example,] the left arm, the right arm, even elbows, your stomach, chest, and neck, like all the different things.”*
– a person with mobility disabilities and mental health conditions

*“I have a limb difference, [and I am] a left forearm amputation. So I would really like to see characters where maybe they don't have two long arms, but they have one long standard arm and one shorter [arm], like to the elbow. Or even if they do have two long arms, but one of them doesn't have a hand, or just one round-off around the wrist [...] instead of extending completely with a five-fingered hand.”*
– an amputee

*“I have one eye that's in a completely different shape than the other. So I think being able to customize your eyes to two different shapes should reflect what is actually going on on your face. Now you can only pick one set.”*
– a person with visual and mobility impairments
